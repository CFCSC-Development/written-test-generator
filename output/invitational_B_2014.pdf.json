However, there is also prefix notation, where the operators are before the operands, such as + 3 * 5 6, and postfix \nnotation, operators after operands, like this: 3 5 6 * +. Notice carefully that the operands never move around: only the \noperators change places. Here is another example: the infix expression 6 * 7 + 9 - 8 * 2 translates the prefix expression  \n- + * 6 7 9 * 8 2, and 6 7 * 9 + 8 2 * - for postfix. Given these examples to examine and study carefully, which \nof the prefix expressions below matches the infix expression shown? \n \nA+B-C*D+E^F",

    "questionDescription": "xx  \nA well-known graph problem studied by Leonard Euler had to do with the town of Konigsberg, in which there was an island at \nthe point where the river Pregel forked. There were seven bridges connecting the island with the two banks of the river and the \nland between the forks, as shown in the picture.  His question was whether or not there was a way to cross the seven bridges in a \ncontinuous walk through town without recrossing any of them. For example, he might start a path starting on the B side of town, \ncross over one of the two bridges to the island (A) and then on across to the south bank (D), and then across to the land area \nbetween the forks of the river (C).  This path would be indicated by the letter sequence BAD\nBridges of Konigsberg, a complete Euler path, or Euler tour, would be indicated by 8 letters. There could be any number of \ncombinations. \n \n \nWrite the sequence of eight letters that represent your version of the Euler path for the seven bridges of Konigsberg.
